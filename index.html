        <p class="jobinfo">[2022 - Present] - Austin, Texas, United States</p>
        <p>My role was to maintain and improve the performance of an AI platform for document processing, mostly
            focusing on the extraction of tabular data.<br />Documents were given from clients in the most various
            formats and the task was to automatize extraction covering the majority of cases to minimize the validation
            effort from data entry units.<br />The majority of the effort was to ensure the extraction in case of weird
            table formats, misspellings, OCR mistakes, abbreviations, tables without headers or following to the next
            pages, poorly scanned documents, etc...</p>
        <p class="jobtitle">Senior Data Scientist at Cartrack Asia Pacific</p>
        <p class="jobinfo">[2020 - 2022] - Singapore</p>
        <p>I&#39;m currently leading and improving all the company&#39;s
            Computer Vision and Deep Learning solutions following the entire product pipeline from the POCs to the final
            deployable models on the boards.<br />We are currently working on Driver/in-cabin monitoring, as well as
            ADAS systems algorithms.<br />Aggregating multiple video sources and generating our datasets, allow us
            to monitor the status of the driver and the passengers and track surrounding vehicles, on embedded boards
            with restrictive computational robustness and compatibility constraints, and low-cost
            hardware like CEVA, AmLogic, RockChip, Xilinx, and other cheap platforms.<br />We are working on data
            collection, Semi-supervised labeling, data cleaning, Multi-Task Learning, Neural Architecture Search, custom
            losses, network surgery, pruning, regularization, fine-tuning, Quantization Aware Training, Transfer
            Learning, and Semi-supervised Learning.<br />We are using Keras, Tensorflow, Caffe, PyTorch, ONNX, NumPy,
            Pandas, for design and C++, OpenCV for deployment.</p>

        <p class="jobinfo">[2018 - 2020] - Brescia, Italy</p>
        <p>As a DSP engineer and AI data scientist, my role consisted in exploring RGB/ IR camera firmware and embedded
            software improvements.<br />I worked on ALPR cameras, boosting performances and accuracy tradeoffs, using
            robust real-time DSP algorithms, and improving Deep Learning architectures.<br />Fast and robust FPGA
            solutions allowed us to perform real-time on embedded platforms with extremely restrictive computational
            constraints, and low-cost hardware. I&#39;m constantly using Neural Architecture Search,
            optimization, regularization, pruning, fine-tuning, quantization, Unsupervised Learning, Transfer Learning,
            and Generative Networks.</p>
        <p class="jobtitle">Artificial Intelligence &amp; Data Processing Engineer at Leonardo</p>
        <p class="jobinfo">[2017 - 2018] - Catania, Italy</p>
        <p>Research and development on fast distributed algorithms for real-time, multiple-object tracking embedded on
            multiple-camera autonomous surveillance systems, including automatic camera calibration, vehicle and
            pedestrian tracking, classification, and further elaboration such as traffic monitoring and security
            systems.<br />Other minor projects involved the processing of different data sources such as GPS, Radars, and
            other sensors' time-series data.<br />I&#39;m using Python, OpenCV, scikit_learn, CNTK, GeoPandas, Keras, R,
            Tensorflow for prototyping demos for clients.</p>

        <p>Research and development of AI algorithms for image classification, document processing, segmentation and
            tables/charts/graphs data extraction.<br />I was responsible for the whole process from the Python
            prototyping to the developing of demos for clients and agile deployment of Web API and REST Services on
            AWS.<br />Make profiling and quality performance tests of our software.<br />Comparing them to the most
            relevant competitors to decide and plan the next research steps and product improvements in short

        <p class="jobtitle">Research Fellow in Image Processing at DLR (German Aerospace Center)</p>
        <p class="jobinfo">[2013 - 2014] - Munich, Germany</p>
        <p>Future HRWS SAR images will provide fast time series of relief models of the globe to monitor Earth's surface
            evolution, improving research in the biosphere, lithosphere, and hydrosphere dynamics.<br />Such a huge amount of
            data will need an on-board pre-processing to reduce downlinking data volume. My role consisted in
            researching embedded-optimized solutions joining the implementation of interpolation for Staggered SAR
            signal resampling with lowpass FIR filtering, evaluating optimal compromises between data accuracy and
            computational costs of the signal processing.</p>
